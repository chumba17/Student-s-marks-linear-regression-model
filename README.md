# Students-marks-linear-regression-model
A linear regression model to predict the marks of the student given the number of courses and time studied

What this model tries to answer is if given the number of course a students takes and the number of hours the student spends studying, is it possible to predict the marks the student got?
In this, I use both univariate and multivariate regression to try and create the best model to solve the problem
